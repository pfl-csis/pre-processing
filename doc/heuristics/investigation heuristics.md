# Human heuristics when analyzing tickets


## Member 1

1. Check past tickets
2. Check initiator account -> see if known admin
3. Pattern recognition
4. Timing analysis
-- case: no past tickets
1. Search online for alert name
2. Verify alert behavior
3. Checking company type -> Contextualize the alert



## Member 2

-- case: 
1. Check entities for unique member: Prioritize Device, Process, User.
2. Check previous tickets for same entities. (Prioritize own tickets)
3. Follow ticket chain (Prioritize own tickets)
4. Prioritize certain analysts playing to their strengths.
-- case: no past tickets
1. Behavior analysis -> Read incident/alert description.
2. Check services we support.
3. Find missing entities
4. Determine ASAP if response actions are needed.
    1. MDE response actions to avoid further compromise.
    2. Escalate alert if required (ex: Incident ongoing)
  (STEP 4 is not part of the member's heuristics, instead is part of the member workflow )

Why does reporting matters:
    Actions without reporting are not considered.
    Reporting should be targeted
    A report is the final product.

Reporting is very important, clarity: Conciseness and priority.

Why do we need AI for reporting?/ Why do we want
    - Efficiency
    - Teams feels empowered. 
    

    Business perspective:
    


    Personal point of view:
        - Enable workers
        - 


Case Medium alert:
    Push out 30 mins sooner bc why
    More security
    More quality


Connection to C2:
    Contextualize technical jargon.

Customer 1:             CIO <> Security
Customer 2: Bunker Holding  <>
